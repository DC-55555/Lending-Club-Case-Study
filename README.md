## Conclusions
- The company has not verified the sources of the client while sanctioning the loan. Further, those clients did not repay the loan and defaulted the loan resulting in loss of the company.
- The majority of clients who have defaulted the loan have an annual income of less than Rs.75,000. The bank did not verify their capability to repay the loan and sanctioned some amount which was way over their capability to repay. This resulted in loss of the company.
- The company has given loans to clients to either stay on rent or have mortgaged their house. As, such client will have a monthly debt expense of either paying the rent or paying EMI, they were already in debt. This loan added to their debt which resulted in debt_consolidation. As a result, these clients did not repay their loan and have defaulted which resulted in loss of the company.
