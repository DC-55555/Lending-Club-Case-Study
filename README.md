## Conclusions
- Most loan defaulters have an income of less than 55,000. Therefore, more interest should be charged for higher income groups.
- Borrowers from the 'ID' state spend above their means and are more likely to default. There must be stricter criteria to grant them the loan.
- Most loans are defaulted by low-income groups. However, interest rates charged to them are the lowest. This is causing more crdit loss.
- Loans taken for Debt Consolidation are one of the highest.
- 'F' grade loans have the highest amount of loan defaulters. Set lower loan limits for 'F' grade loans. Restricting the loan amount reduces the potential loss in case of default.
